# FlyHigh - Airline Reservation System

Airline Reservation System contains the details about flight schedules and its fare tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline’s inventory contains all flights with their available seats. The Airline Reservation System makes it easy for the passengers to find all the required flight related information under one roof. One of the core functions of the inventory management of airline reservations is the inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available for different booking classes, by opening and closing individual booking classes for sale.
